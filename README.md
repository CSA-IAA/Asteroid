# Asteroid
This is a game in which users (space ship) on the left side of the screen are shooting asteroids (coming from right side of the screen) for points. For each asteroid they get 100 points, they lose 100 for each that gets through. For special asteroids, they get 250 points and do not lose any points if the asteroid goes off screen. However, they do lose a life if the bonus asteroid hits them. The user starts with three lives, and loses one for each time they are hit. The user moves up and down and can shoot their laser multiple times. Once they die, high scores are displayed and then the game restarts. There is background music, music for when you shoot lasers, and music when the laser hits the asteroid. Play the game to find out more!
